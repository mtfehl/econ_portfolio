## Michael Fehl

**BSc in Economics** from **UNC Chapel Hill**.

**MSc Economics Student @ Barcelona School of Economics**

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Economics at the **Barcelona School of Economics**. I specialize in **Development Economics** and **Public Policy**, with a technical focus on **Causal Inference**. 

I enjoy applying econometric methods to real-world datasets to inform policy and influence decision-making. I hope to make an impact with my work, no matter the size, as I believe that in data we can can extract important information and uncover hidden patterns that teach us more about the world we live and and strive to improve it the best way possible.
