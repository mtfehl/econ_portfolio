## About Me

**BSc in Economics** from **UNC Chapel Hill**.

**MSc Economics Candidate @ Barcelona School of Economics**

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Economics at the Barcelona School of Economics. My research interests revolve around game theory, causal inference, public policy, and network analysis. 

I am passionate about applying econometric methods to real-world datasets to inform policy decisions and drive impactful change. I believe that through data, we can uncover hidden patterns and extract valuable insights that help us better understand and improve the world around us.

Beyond core economics, I am also deeply interested in dynamic data visualizations and machine learning methods to enhance data interpretation and decision-making.
